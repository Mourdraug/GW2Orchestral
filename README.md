# Gw2Orchestral
Gw2Orchestral is a rewrite of my earlier proof of concept project playing music-macros for Guild Wars 2 synchronized by external server.
My earlier project was using gw2mb format but since it's editor is really hard to use especially for longer sheets and multiple instruments I decided to make editor part of this project.
So project should ultimately consist of 3 components:
* Synchronizing Server
* Client
* Sheet Editor
